# ☕ Café Menu

This is a beginner HTML and CSS project I built as part of the **freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design** certification course.

## About the Project

A simple and responsive web page that displays a fictional café menu. It uses semantic HTML elements and clean CSS styling to structure and beautify the layout. This project helped me understand:

- Basic CSS styling and formatting
- Semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, etc.)
- Page layout and structure using `class` selectors
- Linking external stylesheets

## My Process

I initially built and tested the project on **CodePen** and later transferred it to GitHub after writing the code manually in my notebook and carefully uploading it.

## How to View the Project

You can view the project by opening the `index.html` file in your browser.  
Once deployed, the GitHub Pages link will be added here.

## Additional Notes

This is my second practice project from the [freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) course.

I completed the **Cat Photo App** first, but started uploading from this project onward as I was getting used to GitHub.  
The Cat Photo App will be uploaded soon!
